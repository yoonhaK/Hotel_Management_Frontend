## Description
- As the pandemic has made Vancouver tourism set record low numbers, it is an optimal time for hotels and similar accommodations to transition to a modern management system. Our ideal and completed product will be a cloud-based, multi-platform hotel management system capable of handling bookings, reservation management, and staff management. The incentive for hotels to transition to our product is that it is compact and capable of handling multiple tasks that would require multiple applications or 3rd-party vendors. For instance, instead of having to work with websites like Expedia or Booking.com and losing revenue from commissions, hotels could use our system which has a built in reservation booking and management system. In essence, it is an “all-in-one” system. One platform for all.

- The guest is able to make a reservation for a desired period with providing their personal information.
